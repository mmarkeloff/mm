# Build

Since [mm](https://github.com/mmarkeloff/mm) is header-only library, it does not require any build steps, but it does require downloading the requirements.

## Prerequisites
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - [CMake](https://cmake.org/)

## Linux/macOS

``` bash
> git clone https://github.com/mmarkeloff/mm.git
> cd mm
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..
```
